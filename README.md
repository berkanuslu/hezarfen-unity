# Hezarfen: Galata 2D Platformer Game

Hezarfen:Galata is a 2D Platformer Game which is developed with Unity game engine. I started to prototype in 2012 with Unity 3.x version. Then I started to develop this project at 2014 with Unity 4.x. I have developed this project from an asset store package that I bought. I upgraded the project to Unity 2017 version. I made a lot of improvement and almost rewrote many parts.

With this codebase, maybe you can find something what you need or new ways to implement your ideas or change all images with your image set, and publish your game. If you earn a lot of money with this codebase unlike me, you owe to share some interesting or useful scripts as open source to improve our community.
